# Clatest (covid latest)

Welcome to the documentation for the `clatest` command line tool.

This is a small project to let you get the latest Covid numbers from the cmd line. The scope of the tool is really narrow, and shouldn't be expected to do all the things you want.

The data is obtained from [https://disease.sh](https://disease.sh), please have a look at the [official documentation](https://disease.sh/docs/) for more information. For the purpose of this app, the John Hopkins data is queried.
