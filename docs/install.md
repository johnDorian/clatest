# Installation

The easiest way to install to grab a binary from the github [releases](https://github.com/johnDorian/clatest/releases/latest) page.

### Building from source

If you want to build the binary from source and you have go installed, you should be able to build the binary using: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnDorian/clatest.git
task build
```

If you don't have task installed, you can grab it at [taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev) or you can just run: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnDorian/clatest.git
go build . 
```
